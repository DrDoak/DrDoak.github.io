							<p class="ev-text" style="font-style: italic;">You are a "spirit", you are built from the thoughts and emotions of human beings, as is everything in your spirit world. But when a hidden force starts manipulating people in the real world, chaos erupts in your world as well. </p>
							<p class="smaller-text"> Little Deity is my current<span style="color:#FF7D14"> Unity</span> project, meant to be a place for me to constatly improve my <span style="color:#FF7D14">2D animation</span>, as well as <span style="color:#FF7D14">C-sharp</span> programming skills. The game is a no-holding-back, fast paced action game that emphasizes ease-of-entry without compromising depth. Using innovative controls and "smart" automatic systems, it is intended to make anyone able to do something that would be hard in any other game. I use this project as an opportunity to explore new skills, including developing <span style="color:#FF7D14">shaders</span> for artistic flair, <span style="color:#FF7D14">creating a custom programming language</span> to speed up cutscene creation, <span style="color:#FF7D14">serializing save files</span> and much more! </p>

It explores the possibilities of Unity's unique <span style="color:#FF7D14">component based architecture</span> by dynamically adding and removing components to create new prefabs on the spot.

It is an action 2D side-scrolling game with increased emphasis on NPC interactions and relationships. In this game, every little action an NPC "sees" will be stored, remembered, and used in future decisions. Underneath the hood is a system that makes use of elements from <span style="color:#FF7D14">logical programming languages</span> to store and match "predicates" of information, and a simple <span style="color:#FF7D14">machine learning</span> using <span style="color:#FF7D14">activation functions</span> to make decisions</p>

This project, like many of my indie projects, was done on a small team with <span style="color:#FF7D14">Agile</span> methodology. Here, I learned how to make the best use of <span style="color:#FF7D14">Regular playtesting</span> to set goals. The project uses a custom <span style="color:#FF7D14">physics engine</span> making use of <span style="color:#FF7D14">raycasting</span> for hit detection.</p>

From hardware components, to shaders, to <span style="color:#FF7D14">virtual disk systems</span>,to graphics drivers, to projectors, to light sensors, to servos, I apply my skills across a huge variety of applications. Some of the integration we do ourselves, with our own <span style="color:#FF7D14">C++</span> programs managing some hardware, and <span style="color:#FF7D14">Python</span> and <span style="color:#FF7D14">Powershell</span> scripts to speed up some processes.

A Cybersecurity training group wanted to analyze not only how well students did, but also exactly what they were interacting with throughout the training process. Through my <span style="color:#FF7D14">Python</span> application, we <span style="color:#FF7D14">parsed</span> log files into meaningful classes. From there, I was able to create a <span style="color:#FF7D14">javascript</span> interface to an interactive timeline of all student activities, along with plentiful filters to help the group analyze what promoted engagement</p>
							<p class="smaller-text">In addition, I explored innovative means of determining analyzing student behavior for adaptive training simulations. I worked on extension's to Soar's <span style="color:#FF7D14">C++</span> based Next Generation Threat System that improved the ability for the program to categorize what the student is currently doing</p>
