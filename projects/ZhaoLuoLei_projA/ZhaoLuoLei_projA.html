<br>Welcome to the Imperial Fleet, Pilot.<br>

Your exceptional performance at the Imperial Academy has earned you<br>
the honor of piloting the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle,  one of the finest<br>craft in the entire galaxy, and the Emperor's own personal craft of choice.<br><br>

Your commander has been gracious enough to grant you time to practice piloting the craft.<br><br>
The two wing-mounted Taim & Bak KX5 Laser cannons will be set on auto-sentry mode and will blast any Rebel scum that interfere with this training session.<br><br>

      <button type="button" onclick="toggleTurret()">Press this to Toggle Auto Turrets</button> <br><br>
The controls for this craft are simple:<br><br>

Simply <b>click</b> on a position on the screen, and the twin SFS-204 ion engines will allow the craft to hover to whatever position you desire.<br><br>

<b>Click and drag</b> to change the orientation of the craft. Try not to drag off the screen, or the drag function will get stuck. To return to normal, click anywhereon the screen again. Be careful though, the Empire would not look kindly upon any destroyed vessels. <br><br>

Press <b>up</b> on the keypad to bring the tri-wings to landing position.<br><br>

Press <b>down</b> to bring them back to flying position.<br><br>

We placed a twin turbo-laser battery to guard you while you are training.<br>
If you want the turret to rotate faster clockwise, press <b>right</b>. <br>
To make the turret rotate faster counterclockwise, press <b>left</b>.<br><br>

Now, go forth and inspire dread among the Rebellion!
